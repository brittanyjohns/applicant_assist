About Me
Tenacious, full stack software developer with an unstoppable desire to learn and a passion for
problem solving. Over the last six years, I’ve moved around from product to product, based on the
needs of the company. With an innate ability to learn on the fly, I’m able to jump to where I’m needed
& welcome every opportunity. I'm self taught, starting my career from Ruby on Rails tutorials back in
2015, so I'll never shy away from a challenge or opportunity to learn something new.
